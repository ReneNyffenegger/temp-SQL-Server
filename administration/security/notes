  - Server-level permission can come from membership in the fixed server roles
    or user-defined server roles. Everyone belongs to the public fixed server
    role and receives any permission assigned there.
  - Server-level permissions can come from permission grants to logins or
    user-defined server roles.
  - Database-level permission can come from membership in the fixed database
    roles or user-defined database roles in each database. Everyone belongs to
    the public fixed database role and receives any permission assigned there.
  - Database-level permissions can come from permission grants to users or
    user-defined database roles in each database.
  - Permissions can be received from the guest login or guest database user if
    enabled. The guest login and users are disabled by default.
  - Windows users can be members of Windows groups that can have logins. SQL
    Server learns of Windows group membership when a Windows user connects and
    presents a Windows token with the security identifier of a Windows group.
    Because SQL Server does not manage or receive automatic updates about
    Windows group memberships, SQL Server cannot reliably report the
    permissions of Windows users that are received from Windows group
    membership.
  - Permissions can be acquired by switching to an application role and
    providing the password.
  - Permissions can be acquired by executing a stored procedure that includes
    the EXECUTE AS clause.
  - Permissions can be acquired by logins or users with the IMPERSONATE
    permission.
  - Members of the local computer administrator group can always elevate their
    privileges to sysadmin. (Does not apply to SQL Database.)
  - Members of the securityadmin fixed server role can elevate many of their
    privileges and in some cases can elevate the privileges to sysadmin. (Does
    not apply to SQL Database.)
  - SQL Server administrators can see information about all logins and users.
    Less privileged users usually see information about only their own
    identities.
