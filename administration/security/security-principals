Security principal is the official name of the identities that use SQL Server
and that can be assigned permission to take actions. They are usually people or
groups of people, but can be other entities that pretend to be people. The
security principals can be created and managed using the Transact-SQL listed,
or by using SQL Server Management Studio.


Principals (Database Engine)
----------------------------
   Principals are entities that can request SQL Server resources.
   
   Like other components of the SQL Server authorization model, principals
   can be arranged in a hierarchy.
   
   The scope of influence of a principal depends on the scope of the
   definition of the principal:
     - Windows
     - server
     - database;
   and whether the principal is indivisible or a collection.
   A Windows Login is an example of an indivisible principal, and
   a Windows Group is an example of a principal that is a collection.
   
   Every principal has a security identifier (SID).
