Security principal is the official name of the identities that use SQL Server
and that can be assigned permission to take actions. They are usually people or
groups of people, but can be other entities that pretend to be people. The
security principals can be created and managed using the Transact-SQL listed,
or by using SQL Server Management Studio.
