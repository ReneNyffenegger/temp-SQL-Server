Only server-level permissions can be added to user-defined server roles.
To list the server-level permissions, execute the following statement.
The server-level permissions are:
   SELECT * FROM sys.fn_builtin_permissions('SERVER') ORDER BY permission_name;  

CREATE SERVER ROLE  creates a user defined server role

Since SQL Server 2012, it has been possible to define custom server-roles
