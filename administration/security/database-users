Every database user belongs to the public database role.

When a login or user has not been granted or denied specific permissions on
a securable, the login or user inherits the permissions granted to public
on that securable.

Logins are granted access to a database by creating a database user in a
database and mapping that database user to login. Typically the database user
name is the same as the login name, though it does not have to be the same.
Each database user maps to a single login. A login can be mapped to only one
user in a database, but can be mapped as a database user in several different
databases.

guest user
---------
   Each database includes a guest.
   
   Permissions granted to the guest user
   are inherited by users who have access to the database,
   but who do not have a user account in the database.
   
   The guest user cannot be dropped, but it can be disabled by revoking
   it's CONNECT permission.
   The CONNECT permission can be revoked by executing REVOKE CONNECT FROM GUEST;
   within any database other than master or tempdb.
