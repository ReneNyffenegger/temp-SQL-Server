Logins are individual user accounts for logging on to the SQL Server Database
Engine. SQL Server and SQL Database support logins based on Windows
authentication and logins based on SQL Server authentication

Every login belongs to the public fixed server role.

Compare with -> security principals

Logins are granted access to a database by creating a database user in a
database and mapping that database user to login.

Typically the database user name is the same as the login name, though it does
not have to be the same.
Each database user maps to a single login. A login can
be mapped to only one user in a database, but can be mapped as a database user
in several different databases.

When a login or user has not been granted or denied specific permissions on
a securable, the login or user inherits the permissions granted to public
on that securable.

logins can be queried from sys.server_principals

Certificate-based SQL Server Logins
-----------------------------------
 Server principals with names enclosed by double hash marks (##) are
 for internal system use only.
 
 The following principals are created from certificates when SQL Server is
 installed, and should not be deleted:
   ##MS_SQLResourceSigningCertificate##
   ##MS_SQLReplicationSigningCertificate##
   ##MS_SQLAuthenticatorCertificate##
   ##MS_AgentSigningCertificate##
   ##MS_PolicyEventProcessingLogin##
   ##MS_PolicySigningCertificate##
   ##MS_PolicyTsqlExecutionLogin##

 These principal accounts do not have passwords that can be changed by
 administrators as they are based on certificates issued to Microsoft.
