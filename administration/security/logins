Logins are individual user accounts for logging on to the SQL Server Database
Engine. SQL Server and SQL Database support logins based on Windows
authentication and logins based on SQL Server authentication

Logins are granted access to a database by creating a database user in a
database and mapping that database user to login.

Typically the database user name is the same as the login name, though it does
not have to be the same.
Each database user maps to a single login. A login can
be mapped to only one user in a database, but can be mapped as a database user
in several different databases.
