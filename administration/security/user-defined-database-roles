Users with the CREATE ROLE permission can create new user-defined database
roles to represent groups of users with common permissions. Typically
permissions are granted or denied to the entire role, simplifying permissions
management and monitoring. Database users can be added to the database roles by
using the ALTER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER statement.
