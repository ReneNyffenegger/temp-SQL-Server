Users with the CREATE ROLE permission can create new user-defined database
roles to represent groups of users with common permissions. Typically
permissions are granted or denied to the entire role, simplifying permissions
management and monitoring. Database users can be added to the database roles by
using the ALTER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER statement.

Do not add user-defined database roles as members of
fixed roles. This could enable unintended privilege escalation.

The permissions of user-defined database roles can be customized by
using the GRANT, DENY, and REVOKE statements.
