In SQL Server, fixed server roles are a set of pre-configured roles that
provide convenient group of server-level permissions. Logins can be added to
the roles using the
   ALTER SERVER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER
statement

Every login belongs to the public fixed server role.

SQL Database does not support the fixed server roles, but has two roles in the
master database (dbmanager and loginmanager) that act like server roles.

-> fixed-database-roles

The set of fixed server roles is:
   - public (to which everly login belongs)
   - ...
