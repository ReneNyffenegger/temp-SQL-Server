In SQL Server, fixed server roles are a set of pre-configured roles that
provide convenient group of server-level permissions. Logins can be added to
the roles using the
   ALTER SERVER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER
statement

Every login belongs to the public fixed server role.

SQL Database does not support the fixed server roles, but has two roles in the
master database (dbmanager and loginmanager) that act like server roles.

-> fixed-database-roles

The set of fixed server roles is:
   - sysadmin
        o encompasses all other roles and has unlimited scope.
        o Do not add principals to this role unless they
          are highly trusted.
        o sysadmin role members have irrevocable administrative
          privileges on all server databases and resources.
   - bulkadmin 
        o allows users to insert the contents of any local file
          into a table, which could jeopardize data integrity.
   - public
        o Every login belongs to public
        o public role cannot be dropped
        o permissions can be revoked from the public role
        o Compare with public database role.
