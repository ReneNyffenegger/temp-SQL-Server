Fixed database roles are a set of pre-configured roles that provide convenient
group of database-level permissions. Database users and user-defined database
roles can be added to the fixed database roles using the
 ALTER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER statement

-> fixed-server-roles
-> user-defined-database-roles

The set of fixed database roles is:
   - db_owner
   - public (to which every database user belongs)
     Compare with the public server role.
   - ...
   
db_owner
--------
   The dbo user account is not the same as the db_owner fixed database role,
   and the db_owner fixed database role is not the same as the user account
   that is recorded as the owner of the database
