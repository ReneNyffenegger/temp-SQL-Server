Fixed database roles are a set of pre-configured roles that provide convenient
group of database-level permissions. Database users and user-defined database
roles can be added to the fixed database roles using the
 ALTER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER statement
 
Fixed database roles have a pre-defined set of permissions that are
designed to allow you to easily manage groups of permissions. 

-> fixed-server-roles
-> user-defined-database-roles

Every database user belongs to the public database role.

Do not add user-defined database roles as members of
fixed roles. This could enable unintended privilege escalation.

The set of fixed database roles is:
   - db_owner
       o Members of the db_owner role can perform all
         configuration and maintenance activities on the database.
   - public
       o Every database user belongs to public
       o public role cannot be dropped
       o permissions can be revoked from the public role
       o Compare with the public server role.

--------
   The dbo user account is not the same as the db_owner fixed database role,
   and the db_owner fixed database role is not the same as the user account
   that is recorded as the owner of the database
