Fixed-database roles are defined at the database level and exist in each database

Fixed database roles are a set of pre-configured roles that provide convenient
group of database-level permissions. Database users and user-defined database
roles can be added to the fixed database roles using the
 ALTER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER statement
 
Fixed database roles have a pre-defined set of permissions that are
designed to allow you to easily manage groups of permissions. 

-> fixed-server-roles
-> user-defined-database-roles

Every database user belongs to the public database role.

Do not add user-defined database roles as members of
fixed roles. This could enable unintended privilege escalation.

There are also some special-purpose database roles in the msdb database.

The set of fixed database roles is:
   - db_owner
       o Members of the db_owner role can perform all
         configuration and maintenance activities on the database.
   - public
       o Every database user belongs to public
       o public role cannot be dropped
       o permissions can be revoked from the public role
       o Compare with the public server role.

       and the db_owner fixed database role is not the same as the user account
       that is recorded as the owner of the database
  - db_securityadmin
     o can modify role membership for custom roles only and manage permissions. 
     o can potentially elevate their privileges and their actions should be monitored

MSDB roles
----------
   The msdb database contains the special-purpose roles:
     - db_ssisadmin
     - db_ssisoperator
     - db_ssisltduser   : Members of these database roles can administer and use SSIS. 
                       ( Instances of SQL Server that are upgraded from an earlier version might
                         contain an older version of the role that was named using Data
                         Transformation Services (DTS) instead of SSIS.)
                         
     - dc_admin
     - dc_operator
     - dc_proxy         : Members of these database roles can administer and use the data collector
     
     - db(?) policyAdminstratorRole : can perform all configuration and maintenance               
                                      activities on Policy-Based Management policies and conditions
