Fixed database roles are a set of pre-configured roles that provide convenient
group of database-level permissions. Database users and user-defined database
roles can be added to the fixed database roles using the
 ALTER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER statement

   - db_owner
   - public
       o Every database user belongs to public
       o public role cannot be dropped
       o permissions can be revoked from the public role
       o Compare with the public server role.
